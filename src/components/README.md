# Components Directory

This directory contains reusable Vue components for the Crew Call application.

## Structure

- Place reusable components here
- Each component should be in its own file
- Use PascalCase for component file names
- Include TypeScript interfaces for props when needed

## Example Component Structure

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Component template -->
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
// Component logic
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Component styles */
</style>
```

## Best Practices

- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Include proper documentation
- Test components thoroughly
