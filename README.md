# Crew Call Frontend

A modern Vue.js frontend application for the Crew Call team communication platform.

## User Journey



Taylor opens CrewCall and creates a new event called “Weekly Chores” to organize household responsibilities. They navigate to the new Members tab and add all roommates, instantly seeing the complete member list appear on the event page. From there, Taylor creates a duty titled “Clean Bathroom,” adds details and a due date, and assigns it directly to “Jacob” from the member dropdown. The shared dashboard updates immediately: everyone can now see the new duty, and CrewCall’s counters automatically reflect one active duty and one assigned member.

Later, when Jacob finishes cleaning, they open the same event, mark “Clean Bathroom” as done, and watch the progress bar and counters update in real time — one fewer active duty, one more completed. To keep the event tidy, Taylor archives the completed duty, which moves it to a separate “Archived Duties” section. The main task list now shows only pending chores, giving everyone a clear view of what still needs attention. Through this smooth and reactive flow, CrewCall makes adding members, assigning duties, tracking progress, and archiving completed work effortless and transparent for the whole household.
