# Crew Call Frontend

A modern Vue.js frontend application for the Crew Call team communication platform.

## User Journey



Taylor opens CrewCall and creates a new event called “Weekly Chores” to organize household responsibilities. Within the event, they add a duty titled “Clean Bathroom,” specifying what needs to be done and when. From the assignment screen, Taylor selects “User 2” to take on that duty, instantly updating the shared task list for everyone involved. Later, when User 2 completes the chore, they open the same event and mark “Clean Bathroom” as done, visibly updating the task’s status to “Completed.” The event page now clearly shows which duties are finished and which still need attention, giving everyone in the group a quick overview of progress. Through this simple flow, CrewCall makes creating, assigning, and tracking household chores effortless and transparent for all users.
